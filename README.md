A stack that you can have up and running in less than 25 minutes, so you can focus on making the real thing. Ideal for hackathons, prototypes, MVPs, idea validation, or kickstarting your startup. Including registration, login, insert and retrieve info from a database, email integration, and have it all deployed on Heroku.
